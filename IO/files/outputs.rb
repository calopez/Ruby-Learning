# THE STANDARD I/O GLOBAL VARIABLES
# The main difference between STDIN and $stdin (and the other pairs likewise)
# is that youâ€™re not supposed to reassign to the constant but you can reassign to 
# the variable. 
# 
# The variables give you a way to modify default standard I/O stream behaviors 
# without losing the original streams.
